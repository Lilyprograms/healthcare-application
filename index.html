          Blood sampling techniques
        </h2>
        <p class="st1">Collecting blood samples and other biological specimens is crucial <br>to the understanding, prevention, and treatment of disease. <br>However, from the patientâ€™s perspective, it can also be painful, unnerving, <br>frightening, and inconvenient. 

          <br>What blood taking technique is used depends at least in part on the nature <br>of the condition being tested for, but most commonly involves inserting a needle into <br>a vein, referred to as a "venipuncture" blood draw. Usually, medical practitioners will draw <br>venipuncture blood samples in their clinic offices or labs, at times convenient for them <br>(if not always for patients).</p>
